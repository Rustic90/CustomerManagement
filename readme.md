<h1> Customer Management System  </h1>

<p> Customer Management System is my C#/.NET project for Code Louisville. The purpose of this project
is to offer a simple system for adding, removing, and searching through customer information. </p>
<p> This program has two main parts - CustomerManagementMain and CustomerManagementTests. These represent the main program and accompanying unit tests. </p>
<p> This project was done in VS code. To run - clone project, open to the CustomerManagementMain folder in command prompt, 'dotnet restore' and then 'dotnet run'. </p>
<p> Customer information is saved in a JSON file and manipulated by the program based on user input </p>
<h3> The following criteria are met by this project: </h3>
<ul>
<li> Implement a master loop console application </li>
<li> Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program </li>
