<h1> Customer Management System  </h1>

<p> Customer Management System is my C#/.NET project for Code Louisville. The purpose of this project
is to offer a simple system for adding, removing, and searching through customer information. </p>
<p> This program has two main parts - CustomerManagementMain and CustomerManagementTests. These represent the main program and accompanying unit tests. </p>
<p> Customer information is saved in a JSON file and manipulated by the program based on user input </p>
